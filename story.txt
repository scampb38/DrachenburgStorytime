The Klimaanlage in the Ratskeller was broken again. 
Patrons in dirndel will find their visit more pleasant. 
Unfortunately the local hund ate the last apfelkuchen.
The Baeckerei was in an uproar for it was the greatest of their Gebaeck.
Frau Eltz showed up in her shiny new Porsche and said "There is plenty of Brot over at the biergarten.
And you can wear your lederhosen, for our klimaanlage will remind you of winter!"
