The Klimaanlage in the Ratskeller was broken again. 
Patrons in dirndel will find their visit more pleasant. 
Unfortunately the local hund ate the last apfelkuchen, and all that was left was a Bratwurst.
The Baeckerei was in an uproar for it was the greatest of their Gebaeck.
Unfortunately the gate had a schloss and no one could get in.
Everyone started getting wettbewerbsfaehig on who could break in.
Frau Eltz showed up in her shiny new Porsche and said "There is plenty of Brot over at the biergarten."
I bought a new BMW, but really wish I had gone with the Porsche.
Frau had forgotten to wear their Lederhoses but was not to worried.
"You should wear your lederhosen, for their klimaanlage will remind you of winter!"
When she arrived to the biergarten, all of the Brot was eaten by the Hund(s) from the Hauptstrasse.
The Hund then went on the hunt for doener while wearing lederhosen and an apfelkuchen hat
What the hund didnt know, was that the brot crumbs on the hauptstrasse were from two kinder.
"Did you two come from the nearby Flughafen?" asked the Hund.
